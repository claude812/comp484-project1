<h1> My Rugby Six Nations  website</h1>
</center>


    <h2>Why have i picked this topic</h2>
<h3>Rugby is something i am very passionate about and love and I grew up watching the six nations so
     i thought this would be a really fun website for me to make that I could add a lot of information to.
    I am really experienced in the sport and played rugby for my school which is the highest level you can play
    outside academy and have also played for Ireland in tag rugby. So this sport is a big passion of mine and im hoping to share some
    of my knowledge</h3>

<aside> <!-- I'm not going to lie to you i was proud of this achievement and wanted to flex it
    so i used needing to get the aside in my website as an excuse to put this piece of info in as
    it isnt part of any of the main info but i just wanted it in the website i have another use of aside further down
    that makes a bit more sense to have in. -->
    <h3>Quick fact about me</h3>
    <p>I will be playing for Ireland in tag rugby again in August.</p>

<h2>What is rugby</h2>
<div class="Scrum">
<h3>Rugby is a similar sport to American football without pads. There are some key differences though.
    In rugby, you can only pass the ball backwards and if you drop it forward or pass it forward and manage
    to regather the ball it results in the opposition getting something called a scrum.This is where the forwards
    who are the players with the numbers 1-8 come together and push the other teams forwards backwards to try to get the
    ball to their side if defending or keep it at their side if attacking.Another difference is the ball is still live after a tackle,
    after a tackle is made a ruck is formed where the team with the ball try keep it till the scrum-half the player with a 9 on his back can pass it
    to a teammate. The defending team can try to steal the ball while this is happening but must stay on their feet if attempting to steal the ball.
    there is also just one team they don't have an offence and defence team and then the final difference is they call a touch-down a try, and they have to touch the ball
    down for it to count and then from 10+ yards away from the end zone they can attempt to kick a 2 point conversion in line with where the ball was placed
    so teams have an easier kick if they place it down closer to the posts.

   <main> <h2>What is the six nations</h2>
<h3>The six nations began as the four nations in 1883. The founding nations were Ireland, England, Scotland and Wales.
Then in 1910 France joined the competition and it became the five nations. It would stay as the five nations for another
    90 years untilItaly joined in the year 2000 to make it what it is known as today. Since then there have been talks
    of Georgia joining and fans wanting a religation promotion system with the European championship but for now it seems
    like it is going to stay as the six nations without any promotion or religation.    So in short the six nations in a
    competition where the UK, Ireland, Italy and France compete against each other  every year.
    England currently are by far the most successful team having won the tournament the most after having a very dominant
    era during the five nations. Recently it has been Wales, Ireland and France that have been the most dominant in the last
    ten years but unfortunately for Wales about five years ago they had a disastrous fall from grace. Due to the end of a
    golden generation and lack of money they went from winning every single game in the tournament one season to consistently
    being bottom two in the tournament table. Although this year Ireland have looked much weaker than normal and more
    in a transition period then then dominance era they are still a strong that doesnt look to be in danger of having the
    fall Wales did especially with the young talent getting brought up into the team like 22 year old Edwin Edogbo for
    example

<aside id="MFP"><!-- This time it was a bit more of a more useful aside which i used to have my favourite player
                     from each team beside the paragraph that said all the teams in it. I used the aside as this wasnt a main text
                      it was a side text-->
    <fieldset> <!-- I used the fieldset to create a labelled box  for my favourite player from each team. -->
        <legend>My Favourite Players From Each Team</legend>

        <p>Ireland: Calvin Nash because he went to my school</p>

        <p>Wales: Jac Morgan their only good player now</p>
        <p>France:Louis Bielle-Bierrey  because hes similar to me size wise and plays same position</p>

<h2>How good are the six nations teams globally</h2>
<h3>
    In the mens games the six nations has three of the top five teams in the world.France are third, England fourth and Ireland
    fifth. This is after a disaster year for Irelands standards that had them drop down all the way from first. Scotland
    and Italy both also rank in the top ten with Wales just ouside at eleventh so outside of the tournament all of the
    teams are very strong globally. This was a big reason for why the six nations didnt introduce relegation and the countries
    in it right now have yearly expenses that are far too high to play in the european championship.
